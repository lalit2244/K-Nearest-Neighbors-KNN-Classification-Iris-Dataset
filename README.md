# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Classification-Iris-Dataset
This project applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to the Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species using sepal and petal measurements. Features are normalized, various K values tested, and results evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and scatter plot visualization.
