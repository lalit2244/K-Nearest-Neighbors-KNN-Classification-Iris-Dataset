Title:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification – Iris Dataset

Description:
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Iris dataset. The aim is to classify flowers into three species based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). The dataset is normalized, and the model is trained with different values of K to find the best performance. Evaluation is done using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, and results are visualized with scatter plots.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Steps to Run:

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run knn_classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda.

Check output for accuracy, confusion matrix, and plots.
